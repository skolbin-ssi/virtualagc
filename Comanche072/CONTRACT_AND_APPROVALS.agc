## Purpose:	A section of Comanche revision 072.
##		It is part of the reconstructed source code for the first
##		release of the software for the Command Module's (CM) Apollo
##		Guidance Computer (AGC) for Apollo 13. No original listings
##		of this program are available; instead, this file was recreated
##		from a printout of Comanche 055, binary dumps of a set of
##		Comanche 067 rope modules, and changelogs between Comanche 067
##		and 072. It has been adapted such that the resulting bugger words
##		exactly match those specified for Comanche 072 in NASA drawing
##		2021153G, which gives relatively high confidence that the
##		reconstruction is correct.
## Assembler:	yaYUL

## Mod history:	2024-05-13 MAS	Created from Comanche 067.
##		2024-05-19 MAS	Updated dates for Comanche 72.

## MAS 2024:  October 20, 1969 was the date Comanche 072 was released to
## Raytheon for manufacture. In reality, an earlier date was likely present
## here. Names and job titles also reflect Apollo 11, and may or may not have
## differed in Comanche 72.
