 * Filename:    processInterruptsAndIO.c
 * Purpose:     This function is used between emulations of LVDC/PTC
 *              instructions.  If external conditions require an interrupt
 *              on the next LVDC/PTC machine cycle, this function is the
 *              one that's supposed to notice that and to set up
 *              the emulation so that the interrupt actually occurs.
 *              Also processes PIO and (for PTC) CIO and PRS.
 * Compiler:    GNU gcc.
 * Reference:   http://www.ibibio.org/apollo
 * Mods:        2020-05-02 RSB  Began.
 *              2020-05-06 RSB  Merged Interrupts, PIO, CIO, PRS processing
 *                              into this one file, since they seem to
 *                              interact a lot.
 *              2020-05-11 RSB  Moved processing of the "interrupt latch"
 *                              from yaPTC.py to here.  I found that the
 *                              PTC ADAPT Self-Test Program expected to be
 *                              able to read back the contents of the
 *                              interrupt latch the very next instruction
 *                              cycle after it had written them out, which
 *                              precludes them being handled by a peripheral
 *                              like yaPTC that's communicating with yaLVDC
 *                              via the "virtual wire" system.  It turns out
 *                              also that there were errors in the yaPTC.py
 *                              implementation of this that I fixed here.
