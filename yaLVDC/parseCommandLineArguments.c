    "              The program will try to read the files B.tsv, B.sym, and\n"

    "              B.src files are used for symbolic debugging. Multiple\n"

    "--cold-start  If used, does not load a core-memory image (see --core)\n"

    "--core=F      The initial core-memory image is filename F. The default\n"
    "              is yaLVDC.core.  Note that the file will be periodically\n"
    "              modified during emulation as core memory changes.  If the\n"
    "              file does not exist initially, then the initial state is\n"
    "              instead taken from the --assembly file, but the --core\n"
    "              file will still be created and periodically updated.\n"
    "--ptc         Emulate a PTC target rather than an LVDC target.\n"
    "--run         Start the LVDC/PTC program running freely.  By default,\n"
    "              (without --run), will simply pause without running.\n"

    "              has no effect on whether a debugger prompt appears.\n"
    "--port=N      Specifies the port number used by the server for virtual\n"
    "              connection to peripherals.  Default is 19653.\n"
    "--divisor=N   Slows down the emulated CPU clock by a factor of N (with\n"
    "              the default obviously being 1).  This is intended to be\n"
    "              used with very slow peripheral emulations, such as yaPTC.py\n"
    "              that cannot keep up with yaLVDC otherwise.\n"
    "The following comment applies only to PTC emulation, and not to LVDC.\n"
    "Regarding debugging using the yaLVDC built-in debugger vs the PTC panel's\n"
    "debugging features, such as the emulated PTC program being paused, single\n"
    "stepped, breakpoints, and so on, these two debugging capabilities\n"
    "are separate and essentially independent.  To a certain extent they can\n"
    "coexist without problems, but it is best to avoid using the yaLVDC debugger\n"
