Execute the simulated CPU.  Expecting to ACCURATELY cycle the simulation every
11.7 microseconds within Linux (or Win32) is a bit too much, I think.
(Not that it's really critical, as long as it looks right from the
user's standpoint.)  So I do a trick:  I just execute the simulation
often enough to keep up with real-time on the average.  AGC time is
measured as the number of machine cycles divided by AGC_PER_SECOND,
while real-time is measured using the times() function.  What this mains
is that AGC_PER_SECOND AGC cycles are executed every CLK_TCK clock ticks.
The timing is thus rather rough-and-ready (i.e., I'm sure it can be improved
a lot).  It's good enough for me, for NOW, but I'd be happy to take suggestions
for how to improve it in a reasonably portable way.*/
