  /*
   * CALL INLINE statements #55 and #56 (see patch56p.c) do not operate as
   * XCOM-I --guess expects.  This pair is *self-modifying* code.  `VAL` (the
   * 2nd parameter of this `SAVE_LITERAL` procedure) is a string descriptor.
   * Inline  #55 copies the length field from `VAL` into the length field of
   * the MVC instruction in inline #56.  This is different from an EX operation,
   * because the change is persistent and inline #56 is executed in-place when
   * the instruction counter gets to it.  We can handle it by just letting
   * #56 read `VAL` itself.
