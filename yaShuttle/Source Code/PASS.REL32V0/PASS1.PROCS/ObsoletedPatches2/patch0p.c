  //             indicates the leading patch number of the block, and
  //             the 2nd is the byte offset of the instruction within

  //          3. Known-problematic translations are marked with the
  //             string  "* * * F I X M E * * *" (without spaces).

  // Note that this instruction is not reachable, as far as I can see.  It's
  // preceded by a GO TO START, and is not labeled, thus itself cannot be the
  // target of an XPL GO TO.  In principle, since it's extremely close to the
  // beginning of PROCEDURE, it's possible (if difficult) for later CALL INLINE
  // statements to branch to it by indexing off the beginning address of the
  // procedure.  However, there is no such manipulation in succeeding
  // CALL INLINE statements.  I infer that this was active code at one time,
  // but became dead code when the GO TO START was added, and for some reason
  // was never subsequently removed.  Alternatively, a debugger could reach
  // it and change the LOWER_BOUND and MODE for COMPACTIFY, so perhaps it's
  // there for debugging purposes.
