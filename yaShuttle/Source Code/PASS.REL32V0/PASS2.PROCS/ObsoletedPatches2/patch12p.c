  //               indicates the leading patch number of the block, and
  //               the 2nd is the byte offset of the instruction within
  //               within the block.
  //            3. Known-problematic translations are marked with the
  //               string  "* * * F I X M E * * *" (without spaces).

  // Note that this instruction isn't reachable via the normal control flow.
  // Rather, it is the target of an EX instruction.  See patch7p.c.
