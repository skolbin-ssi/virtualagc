C/ For a parallelogram, you input the length of the long side, the short
C/ side, and the angle between them (in radians).  It then computes the
C/ positions of the 4 corners on the assumption that a short side and 
C/ long side meet at the origin, that the long side proceeds in the + 
C/ direction along the x-axis, and that the parallelogram is in the 
C/ upper-right quadrant.
