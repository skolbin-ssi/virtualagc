C/ This sample was found on PDF p. 53 of "Programming in HAL/S".
C/ It illustrates the use of double precision.  It reads a 
C/ pair of angles for spring and another pair of angles for fall,
C/ both in radians, and outputs single number representing the
C/ distance of the object in miles. While it doesn't exactly
C/ say what the angles represent, I suppose they must be right 
C/ ascension and declination.
