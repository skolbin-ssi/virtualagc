C/ Adapted from PDF p. 257 of "Programming in HAL/S".  Enclosing 
C/ brackets have been removed from array variables, because they are 
C/ not legal syntax.  As originally divided up in the book, the lines 
C/ are in fact too long for the original HAL/S compiler.  Rather than 
C/ worrying about how to split up multiline (E/M/S) code into shorter 
C/ lines, I've flattened the code into the single-line format.
