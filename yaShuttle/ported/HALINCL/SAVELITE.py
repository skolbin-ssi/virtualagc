Filename:   SAVELITE.py
Purpose:    This is part of the port of the original XPL source code for 
            HAL/S-FC into Python. 
Contact:    The Virtual AGC Project (www.ibiblio.org/apollo).
History:    2023-09-16 RSB  Made a stub for this.
            2023-11-14 RSB  Save string constants in EBCDIC rather than
                            ASCII.

'''
Note that for literals of TYPE==1, the original SAVE_LITERAL() would have 
expected the literal to be loaded into DW[0],DW[1] as an IBM DP float, and
would have expected the 2nd parameter to be DW_AD ... i.e., it would have
expected a *pointer* to the literal's value rather than the value itself.
This is accomplished in Python by using DW_AD() as the 2nd parameter, because
DW_AD() actually provides the desired value rather than a pointer to it.
