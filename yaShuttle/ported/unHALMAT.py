License:    This program is declared by its author, Ron Burkey, to be
            in the Public Domain in the U.S., and can be used or 
            modified in any way desired.
Filename:   unHALMAT.py
Purpose:    To parse a binary HALMAT file output by HAL_S_FC.py.
History:    2023-11-13 RSB  Began.

It is unclear to the extent that the goal of this program can be 
achieved.  Only 3 sources of documentation about the inner structure of
HALMAT are known at this writing:
    REF1: "HALMAT - An Intermediate Language of the First HAL Compiler",
        (1971).  Nominally complete, but is preliminary and contains
        obsoleted ("wrong") data.
    REF2: "HAL/S-360 Compiler System Specification" (1977).  Nominally
        correct and up-to-date, but less than 20% complete due to 
        retaining only changed page vs the previous revision.
    REF3: HAL/S-FC compiler source code.  Generates and parses HALMAT
        code, but almost completely without any semantics.
In other words, there is no known surviving satisfactory documentation
of HALMAT.  This parsing program will be taken as far as I can feasibly
take it under the circumstances.

# PARAGRAPHs.  Each PARAGRAPH consists of some number of OPERATOR and
# OPERAND WORDS (each 32-bits in size).  PARAGRAPHs therefore have sizes
# that are multiples of 4 bytes, but since 7200 bytes will not 
# necessarily hold an integral number of PARAGRAPHs, there may be 
# some unused multiple of 4 bytes at the end of a RECORD.  These unused
