Filename:   xplBuiltins.py
Purpose:    This is part of the port of the original XPL source code for 
            HAL/S-FC into Python.  It contains what might be thought of as the
            global variables accessible by all other source files.
Contact:    The Virtual AGC Project (www.ibiblio.org/apollo).
History:    2023-09-07 RSB  Split the former g.py into two files, this one
                            (xplBuiltins.py) containing just functions, and g.py
                            (which continues to contain all of the variables
                            and constants).
            2024-08-15 RSB  Eliminated standard `ebcdic` module in favor of
                            my own `asciiToEbcdic`, for portability reasons.

The following stuff is for converting back and forth from Python
numerical values to System/360 double-precision (64-bit) floating 
point.

The IBM documentation I've seen for the floating-point format
is pure garbage.  Fortunately, wikipedia ("IBM hexadecimal 
floating-point") explains it very simply.  Here's what it looks 
like in terms of 8 groups of 8 bits each:
    SEEEEEEE FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF ... FFFFFFFF
where S is the sign, E is the exponent, and F is the fraction.
Single precision (32-bit) is the same, but with only 3 F-groups. 
The exponent is a power of 16, biased by 64, and thus represents
16**-64 through 16**63. The fraction is an unsigned number, of
which the leftmost bit represents 1/2, the next bit represents
1/4, and so on. 

As a special case, 0 is encoded as all zeroes.

E.g., the 64-bit hexadecimal pair 0x42640000 0x00000000 parses as:
    S = 0 (i.e., positive)
    Exponent = 16**(0x42-0x40) = 16**2 = 2**8.
    Fraction = 0.0110 0100 ...
or in total, 1100100 (binary), or 100 decimal.

# Here's some stuff intended to functionally replace some of XPL's 'implicitly
# declared' functions and variables while retaining roughly the same syntax.

# Here's are lists of all open "devices", by their "device number". If the 
# device isn't open, then the entry in the inputDevices[] and/or outputDevices[] 
# array(s) is a Python None.  Note that the behavior of output devices 0 and 1
# (both stdout) are hard-coded in the OUTPUT function and bypass the 
# inputDevices[] list entirely.
#
# When there is Python file associated with the device, the value will be a
# Python dictionary structured as follows:
#    {
#        "file":     The associated Python file object,
#        "open":     Boolean (True if open, False if closed),
#        "pds":      For PDS datasets only.  If "pds" isn't present, then the 
#                    file is a flat sequential dataset.  The value is the
#                    entire contents of the file (whether input or output)
#                    as a Python dictionary whose keys are the member names
#                    (each exactly 8 characters, right padded with spaces) and
#                    whose values are Python lists of strings.
#        "buf":      For a sequential file (either input or output), the 
#                    entire contents of the file, buffered as a list of strings.
#                    For a PDS file, the entire contents of the currently
#                    selected member, buffered as a list of strings.  In the
#                    case of a PDS *output* file, the buffer will not be 
#                    physically written to the file until an appropriate call
#                    to MONITOR(1, ...) occurs.
#        "mem":      For a PDS file, the member name last found by 
#                    MONITOR(2).  Not used for a flat sequential file.
#        "ptr":      The index of the last line returned by an INPUT();
#                    for a "buf" it's the index within the file as a whole,
#                    while for a "pds" it's the index within the member,
#    }
# For "pds", the dictionary keys are "member names", each of which is 
# precisely 8 characters long (including padding by spaces on the right).  
# The value associated with a member key is the entire contents of that member 
# as a list of strings.

        Given that 2**24 = 16777216 (8 digits) and 2**56 = 72057594037927936
        (17 digits), it should be the case that SP and DP are *fully* accurate
        only to 7 digits and 16 digits respectively.  Moreover, there is always
        exactly 1 digit (non-zero) to the left of the decimal point.  Therefore,
        for SP and DP, it would be reasonable to have 6 and 15 digits to the
        right of the decimal point respectively. (See also yaHAL-S/palmatAux.py.)

    fileNumber 0,1  stdin, presumably the source code.
    fileNumber 4    Apparently, includable source consists of members of a
                    PDS, and this device number is attached to such a PDS.
    fileNumber 5    Error library (a PDS).
    fileNumber 6    An access-control PDS, providing acceptable language subsets
    fileNumber 7    For reading in structure templates from PDS.

There are cases for certain PDS files where output is both written to the 
file and read back from it as well.  In those cases ... TBD.

The available documentation doesn't tell us what INPUT() is supposed to return
at the end-of-file or end-of-member, though the XPL code I've looked at 
indicates the following:

    End of PDS member           A zero-length string.  E.g., INTERPRE sets
                                a flag called EOF_FLAG upon encountering such a
                                string.
    
    End of sequential file      A zero-length string.  At least, that's what
                                I see in the READ_CARD procedure, which is 
                                what reads the HAL/S source-code files.  
                                However, it's possible for a sequential file to
                                contain zero-length strings other than at the
                                end, so at least for device 0 (source code),
                                I replace zero-length strings by strings which
                                contain a single blank

Originally I thought that STRING() should work just like Python str().  
However, I now realize that what it's intended to do is
to receive a "pointer" like those appearing in LIT2, and to return
the string object associated with that pointer.  The "pointers" in 
LIT2 are 32-bit numbers of the (hex) form:
        TTPPPPPP
where TT is the length-1 of the string and PPPPPP is the "address" of
the string.  Which would be fine if these pointers really all came
from LIT2, because then the string data would always be in the 
LIT_CHAR[] array, so we could just use the offset into the LIT_CHAR[]
array as the address.  

(It turns out that the STRING() function is actually documented, on 
p. 13-4 of IR-182-1, and it's indeed what I said it was just now.)

Unfortunately, those are not the only places the input "pointers" come
from.  I find the following:
    Entries from LIT2[]
    Values provided by MONITOR(23)
    Values computed from (mask << 24) | ADDR(...)
    Entries from VOCAB_INDEX[]
    Entries from CON[]
    Entries from TYPE2[]
    Entries from VALS[]
We consequently have to get this whole chain of stuff working in the
same way, in spite of the fact that there are no absolute addresses
available in this port of the compiler.

Here's the way I've decided to work it.  If STRING() receives a string
as argument, it simply returns it.  However, if it receives a number
as an argument, then it's treated as TTPPPPPP, and the hintArray to which
PPPPPP applies must also be given to it as the array parameter.
If array[PPPPPP] is itself a string, then that's returned.  Finally,
if array[PPPPPP:] consists of numbers, then those are assumed to be
EBCDIC and LL of them are converted to characters and the return value
is the join of all of those characters.
