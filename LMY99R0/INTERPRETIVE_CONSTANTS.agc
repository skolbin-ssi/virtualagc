### FILE="Main.annotation"
## Copyright:	Public domain.
## Filename:	INTERPRETIVE_CONSTANTS.agc
## Purpose:	Part of the reconstructed source code for LMY99 Rev 0,
##		otherwise known as Luminary Rev 99, the third release
##		of the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) software for Apollo 11.
##		It differs from LMY99 Rev 1 (the flown version) only in the
##		placement of a single label. The corrections shown here have
##		been verified to have the same bank checksums as AGC developer
##		Allan Klumpp's copy of Luminary Rev 99, and so are believed
##		to be accurate. This file is intended to be a faithful 
##		recreation, except that the code format has been changed to 
##		conform to the requirements of the yaYUL assembler rather than 
##		the original YUL assembler.

##		2016-12-17 RSB	Proofed text comments with octopus/ProoferComments
##				but no errors found.

## This source code has been transcribed or otherwise adapted from
## digitized images of a hardcopy from the MIT Museum.  The digitization
## was performed by Paul Fjeld, and arranged for by Deborah Douglas of
## the Museum.  Many thanks to both.  The images (with suitable reduction
## in storage size and consequent reduction in image quality as well) are
## available online at www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you
## find that the images are illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org
## about getting access to the (much) higher-quality images which Paul
## actually created.
##
## The code has been modified to match LMY99 Revision 0, otherwise
## known as Luminary Revision 99, the Apollo 11 software release preceeding
## the listing from which it was transcribed. It has been verified to
## contain the same bank checksums as AGC developer Allan Klumpp's listing
## of Luminary Revision 99 (for which we do not have scans).
