# About this Folder

The contents of this folder are **deprecated**.

This is a hypothetical reconstruction of an allegedly-missing revision of the Apollo 11 LM source code, based on a recollection by Jim Kernan (the Apollo 11 Luminary "rope mother") about a last-minute correction (rev 2) that needed to be made to Luminary 99 rev 1, due to an incorrect ephemeris.

Jim's recollection was firm, and he had retold it on several occasions.  Unfortunately, no *other*
documentary evidence has ever been found to support his story as-told.

Eventually, Software Anomaly Report LNY-59 was found, filed by Jim Kernan himself, and tells basically the same story, but focuses not on Luminary 99 rev 1 but rather on Luminary 96.  Thus, it is *now* believed that Jim's story is correct, except that it occurred for Luminary 96 (necessitating a change to Luminary 97).

In other words, there never was a Luminary 99 rev 2, and the "reconstruction" in this folder is worthless.  (Well, not entirely worthless, I suppose, since Luminary 99 rev 1 still did end up with the wrong ephemeris and this "reconstruction" corrects it.  But it's worthless historically!)
