## Purpose:     A section of a reconstructed, mixed version of Sundance
##              It is part of the reconstructed source code for the Lunar
##              Module's (LM) Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) for Apollo 9.
##              No original listings of this program are available;
##              instead, this file was created via disassembly of dumps
##              of various revisions of Sundance core rope modules.

# SUBROUTINE TIMEGMBL:  MOD 0, OCTOBER 1967, CRAIG WORK
#
# TIMEGMBL COMPUTES THE DRIVE TIME NEEDED FOR THE TRIM GIMBAL TO POSITION THE DESCENT ENGINE NOZZLE SO AS TO NULL
# THE OFFSET ANGULAR ACCELERATION ABOUT THE Q (OR R) AXIS.  INSTEAD OF USING AOSQ(R), TIMEGMBL USES .4*AOSQ(R),
# SCALED AT PI/8.                         FOR EACH AXIS, THE DRIVE TIME IS COMPUTED AS ABS(ALPHA/ACCDOT).  A ZERO
# ALPHA OR ACCDOT OR A ZERO QUOTIENT TURNS OFF THE GIMBAL DRIVE IMMEDIATELY.  OTHERWISE, THE GIMBAL IS TURNED ON
# DRIVING IN THE CORRECT DIRECTION. THE Q(R)GIMTIMR IS SET TO TERMINATE THE DRIVE AND Q(R)ACCDOT
# IS STORED TO REFLECT THE NEW ACCELERATION DERIVATIVE.  NEGUQ(R) WILL CONTAIN +1,+0,-1 FOR A Q(R)ACCDOT VALUE
# WHICH IS NEGATIVE, ZERO, OR POSITIVE.

# INPUTS:       AOSQ,AOSR, SCALED AT P1/2, AND ACCDOTQ, ACCDOTR AT PI/2(7).     PI/2(7).
