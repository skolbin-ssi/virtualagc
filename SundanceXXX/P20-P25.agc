# AFTER WHICH THE PROGRAM EXITS TO RDBADEND. IF THE REPOSITION
# FLAG IS NOT PRESENT, THE CONTINUOUS DESIGNATE FLAG (RADMODES
# BIT 15) IS CHECKED. IF PRESENT, ON EXECUTIVE CALL IS IMMEDIATELY
# MADE FOR DODES AFTER WHICH A .5 SECOND WAIT IS INITIATED BEFORE
# REPEATING AT STDESIG. IF THE RR SEARCH ROUTINE (LRS24.1) IS DESIGNATING
# TO A NEW POINT (NEWPTFLG SET) THE CURRENT DESIGNATE TASK IS TERMINATED.
# IF CONTINUOUS DESIGNATE IS NOT WANTED, THE DESIGNATE FLAG (RADMODES
# BIT 10) IS CHECKED. IF NOT PRESENT, THE PROGRAM EXITS TO ENDRADAR TO
# CHECK RR CDU FAIL BEFORE RETURNING TO THE CALLING PROGRAM. IF DESIGNATE
# IS STILL REQUIRED, DESCOUNT IS CHECKED TO SEE IF THE 30 SECONDS HAS

# (RADMODES BIT 10) REMOVED BEFORE EXITING TO RDBADEND. IF

# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

# THIS ROUTINE COMPUTES THE B-VECTORS AND DELTA Q FOR EACH OF THE QUANTITIES MEASURED BY THE RENDEZVOUS
# RADAR.(RANGE,RANGE RATE,SHAFT AND TRUNNION ANGLES). THE ROUTINE CALLS THE INCORP1 AND INCORP2 ROUTINES
# WHICH COMPUTE THE DEVIATIONS AND CORRECT THE STATE VECTOR.

# CALLING SEQUENCE
# THIS ROUTINE IS PART OF P20 RENDEZVOUS NAVIGATION FOR THE LM COMPUTER O NLY. THE ROUTINE IS ENTERED FROM
# R22LEM  ONLY AND RETURNS DIRECTLY TO R22LEM  FOLLOWING SUCCESSFUL INCORPORATION OF MEASURED DATA. IF THE
# COMPUTED STATE VECTOR DEVIATIONS EXCEED THE MAXIMUM PERMITTED. THE ROUTINE RETURNS TO R22LEM  TO DISPLAY
# THE DEVIATIONS. IF THE ASTRONAUT ACCEPTS THE DATA R22LEM  RETURNS TO    LSR22.3 TO INCORPORATE THE
# DEVIATIONS INTO THE STATE VECTOR. IF THE ASTRONAUT REJECTS THE DEVIATIONS, NO MORE MEASUREMENTS ARE
# PROCESSED FOR THIS MARK,I.E.,R22LEM  GETS THE NEXT MARK.

# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

# DRIVES THE RENDEZVOUS RADAR IN A HEXAGONAL SEARCH PATTERN ABOUT THE LOS TO THE CSM (COMPUTED FROM THE CSM AND LM
# STATE VECTORS) CHECKING FOR THE DATA GOOD DISCRETE AND MONITORING THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE RADAR BORESIGHT AND THE
# LM +Z AXIS. IF THIS ANGLE EXCEEDS 30 DEGREES THE PREFERRED TRACKING ATTITUDE ROUTINE IS CALLED TO PERFORM AN
# ATTITUDE MANEUVER.
