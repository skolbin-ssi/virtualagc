The following stuff is for converting back and forth from Python
numerical values to System/360 double-precision (64-bit) floating 
point.

The IBM documentation I've seen for the floating-point format
is pure garbage.  Fortunately, wikipedia ("IBM hexadecimal 
floating-point") explains it very simply.  Here's what it looks 
like in terms of 8 groups of 8 bits each:
    SEEEEEEE FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF ... FFFFFFFF
where S is the sign, E is the exponent, and F is the fraction.
Single precision (32-bit) is the same, but with only 3 F-groups. 
The exponent is a power of 16, biased by 64, and thus represents
16**-64 through 16**63. The fraction is an unsigned number, of
which the leftmost bit represents 1/2, the next bit represents
1/4, and so on. 

As a special case, 0 is encoded as all zeroes.

E.g., the 64-bit hexadecimal pair 0x42640000 0x00000000 parses as:
    S = 0 (i.e., positive)
    Exponent = 16**(0x42-0x40) = 16**2 = 2**8.
    Fraction = 0.0110 0100 ...
or in total, 1100100 (binary), or 100 decimal.
