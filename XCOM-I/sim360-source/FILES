Stony Brook Pascal compiler for the IBM/360.

The State University of New York created a Pascal compiler which was
written in XPL.  Both the Pascal and XPL compilers were released to the
Hercules project many years ago.  The data on that release tape is the
starting point for this project.

Directory Structure

ebcdic
   Contains all the files from the release tape in EBCDIC.
   These EBCDIC source files use 80 character fixed length records
   without End-Of-Line characters such as Carriage-Return or Linefeed.

ascii
   Contains the ASCII version of the original EBCDIC source files.
   The source files from the release contained patches and a program to
   apply those patches.  The patches have been applied to all the files
   in this directory.  This is the place to go to read the code produced
   by SUNY at Stony Brook.

port
   These are the same files found in the ascii directory but they have been
   modified to process source files written in ASCII as well as EBCDIC.
   This should be your starting point if you wish to make modifications
   to the compilers.

simulator
   This is an IBM 360 simulator, which was not on the release tape.  It will
   run the output of both the XPL and Pascal compilers.  This simulator can
   translate files from ASCII to EBCDIC or EBCDIC to ASCII which will allow
   the simulator to run both the original IBM binaries and newly compiled code.

examples
   Example Pascal programs which were included on the original release
   tape.  This directory includes a makefile to help you compile and run
   the programs.

backup.out
   This is a backup copy of xpl.out.
