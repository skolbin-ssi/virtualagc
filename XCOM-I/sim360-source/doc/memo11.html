The Stony Brook PASCAL/360 Compiler</p><br>
This memo describes the functional specification and overall
design goals of a compiler for the programming language PASCAL,
to run on and compile object code for IBM 360/370 computers.<br><br>
1. <u>Language Definition</u>: We have taken as the primary
definition of PASCAL the Revised Report on the Programming Language
PASCAL, as published in [1]. Secondary standards for the
language definition are the PASCAL Programmer&apos;s Manual [1],
and the axiomatic definition given by Hoare and Wirth [2].
We have made only the following changes in the language definition:<br><br>
<p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; text-indent:-5ch; padding:0;">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure and Function parameters are required to be fully
typed. That means that when an element of a parameter list in a
procedure of function declaration is declared to be PROCEDURE or
FUNCTION, that its parameter types must be declared (unless it is
parameterless). For this purpose, we have extended the PASCAL
syntax, as specified by the syntax diagrams in the Appendix to
this Memorandum. Note that the syntax extension still accepts
PROCEDURE or FUNCTION parameters whose argument types are
unspecified, so that no syntax error occurs if programs satisfying
the syntax given in the Revised Report are submitted to the 
compiler.
However, the compiler may note semantic errors,
because of undeclared argument types.</p><br>
<p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; text-indent:-5ch; padding:0;">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The syntactic device referred to in Section 12.3 of the 
Revised Report, by which the output format of integer or real
numbers is specified by a programmer, is not supported in this
compiler. This syntactic device is not consistent with the 
syntax diagrams of the revised report, and was not considered 
to be a worthwhile addition. Instead, format control is achieved
through values of predeclared variables whose values may be reset
by assignment statements. This method of format control is
slightly less flexible than the device specified in the Revised
Report, but also less susceptible to casual error, and thus was
judged preferable. The predeclared variables are called
INTFLIELDSIZE, REALFIELDSIZE, and BOOLFIELDSIZE, and have been 
given initial values of 12, 14, and 6, respectively.<br><br>
Insofar as the compiler is consistent with the standard
definition of the language referred to above, it is correct.
Inconsistencies, if any, are to be judged as compiler errors.</p><br>
2. <u>Implementation Restrictions</u>: We have made implementation
restrictions that we judged to be consistent with the design of the
PASCAL language and with the System 370 architecture.<br><br>
<p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; text-indent:-5ch; padding:0;">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum number of external files supported, in addition
to the standard files INPUT and OUTPUT is 5. File access is through
the OS/370 QSAM macro, which we judge to be consistent with the
definition of sequential files in PASCAL.</p><br>
<p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; text-indent:-5ch; padding:0;">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The range of integer values is -2147483648..2147483647.</p><br>
<p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; text-indent:-5ch; padding:0;">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The precision of representation of real values is six
hexadecimal digits. No extended precision real type has been
provided, although we think this would be desirable, when
implementation on a 32 or 36-bit word machine is contemplated.</p><br>
<p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; text-indent:-5ch; padding:0;">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The internal representation of type CHAR is EBCDIC.</p><br>
<p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; text-indent:-5ch; padding:0;">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a limitation on the length of the statement list
in the body of any individual PASCAL procedure, which is of the 
order of 300 statements. There is no limit on total program length
other than that imposed by the effective address space of the target
computer.</p><br>
<p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; text-indent:-5ch; padding:0;">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;Set types may contain up to 2048 elements. The representation
of values in a subrange type is not the same as the representation
in the base type; the least value in a subrange always is represented
internally by a zero value. However, this representation should
be invisible to the programmer unless he makes use of the standard
function ORD. (For the reason that it allows the programmer to
make use of otherwise invisible details of implementation, we are
not enthusiastic about the inclusion of ORD in the PASCAL language.
However, we have implemented it, in order to remain consistent
with the standard).</p><br>
<p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; text-indent:-5ch; padding:0;">(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no difference in internal representation between
PACKED types and their unpacked equivalents. In fact, they are
also treated as compatible, and the operation of string comparison,
defined on types PACKED ARRAY OF CHAR, is also defined on unpacked
equivalents. The reason for this is that in a byte-addressable
memory, we feel that is makes little sense to extend packing to
the bit level, and so we have packed the storage of <u>all</u>
structured type objects to the byte level. The standard procedures
PACK and UNPACK are supported for the sake of consistency with
the language standard.</p><br>
<p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; text-indent:-5ch; padding:0;">(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;In our implementation, the TAG field in the declaration
of a variant record is mandatory, not optional.</p><br>
<p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; text-indent:-5ch; padding:0;">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;The extensions and restrictions described in [1] for 
the PASCAL 6000 compiler are not applicable.</p><br>
3. <u>Compiler Structure</u>: The design goals for the 
PASCAL/370 compiler are that it should be a production-level
compiler capable of compiling optimized code (as an option), it
should provide highly elastic recovery support programmer debugging
aids including a symbolic post-mortem dump, and an execution profile
listing. We adopted the debugging aids of the Stanford ALGOL W
compiler, 1972 edition, as our design goal. We also intended that
the compiler should be able to run in a memory region of no more
than 120 K bytes for code and be able to run in a memory region of
no more than 120 K bytes for code and data, and that it should
be able to be produced in editions to run under the OS/370, MFT,
MVT and VS2 operating systems. An additional, but principal design
goal is that the compiler should be structured, documented and
written so that any competent systems programmer could maintain his
own copy, or even make some modifications if he felt compelled to.<br><br>
These design goals have resulted in the following design
decisions. Both the compiler and the compiled code are supervised
by resident monitor programs. This decision allows editions of the
compiler to be accommodated to several different operating systems.
The compiler is structured in three passes (four when code optimization
is included). Pass 1 is responsible for lexical and syntax analysis,
and for the extraction of information from the source listing that
will be needed for debugging aids. Pass 1 produces syntax trees,
according to a simplified, punctuation-free syntax described in a
subsequent memorandum. It also produces a skeletal symbol table
containing identifiers and values of constants. These are stored
for reference by Pass 2, on temporary direct-access files. A
paragraphed source listing is prepared at the same time, and is
stored on a sequential access file for retrieval at the conclusion
of execution of the PASCAL program. It can be saved with a compiled
load module if desired.<br><br>
Pass 2 takes as input the skeletal symbol table and syntax
trees produced by Pass 1, and builds the complete symbol table
containing semantic information, allocated storage to constants and
variables, builds a core image of the constant pool needed at runtime,
performs type-checking including legal coercions and folding of 
constants involved in the coercions, and generates symbolic code
triples. The symbolic code is very close to machine code in its
level of operations, but acts on untyped, variable-length operands.
The semantics and format of symbolic code triples are specified in
a subsequent memo.<br><br>
Pass 2 obtains input in blocks corresponding to the individual
procedures and functions of the PASCAL source program. It processes
these one at a time, and blocks its output (symbolic triples) for
temporary storage on a direct (or sequential) access file for
communication to Pass 3. The only portion of the symbol table
that is communicated to Pass 3 is that which gives the storage
assignment and lengths of operands. In case a source program
contains serious errors, compilation will be terminated at the 
conclusion of Pass 2, after all compile-time error checking has
been completed.<br><br>
Pass 3 accepts symbolic triples and operand address and length
data, and generates a load module. It performs all register
allocation, using a dynamic allocation algorithm, and builds a
transfer vector containing the relative entry-point addresses of
procedures and addresses of non-local branch targets. It builds
another vector of execution counters, for subsequent reference by
the execution profile monitor following execution of the object
program.<br><br>
The compiler monitor handles all I/O for the compiler, and
overlays the code segments of Passes 1, 2, and 3.<br><br>
The PASCAL monitor handles loading and relocation (only the
transfer vector elements require address re-computation) of the
PASCAL program and its constants, handles all I/O, manages the
runtime heap, supports calls to most standard procedures and
functions, handles abnormal termination and the post-mortem dump,
and prints the execution profile listing. The post-mortem dump
and execution profile routines are not loaded until termination
of the PASCAL program execution occurs.<br><br>
4. <u>Implementation and Documentation</u>: For reasons of
convenience and familiarity, we have chosen XPL [3] as an
implementation language. While this choice leave something to
be desired in terms of optimization of the efficiency of the 
compiler code (in particular, common subexpression elimination
and folding of constants would be desirable improvements), it
has the advantage that it provides reasonable support for structured
programming, provides the required I/O support, provides efficient
and flexible string-handling, and that we had available a few
compiler development tools compatible with the use of XPL.<br><br>
One of these tools is the XPL monitor, a brief and simple BAL
program that is readily modified to accommodate overlaying of our
multi-pass compiler.<br><br>
Another tool is a parsing-table constructor for LL(1) grammars.
We use this tool to build the tables for a top-down, syntax driven
syntax analyzer for PASCAL. This method of syntax analysis is fast,
requires minimal storage for parsing tables, and permits the use
of elastic syntax-error recovery strategies.<br><br>
Other tools include a package of routines to build, print, and
analyze syntax trees having a variable number of successors to
each node. We employ three principal means of documentation. 
First is a prose description of each major functional module of
the compiler, of the procedures each contains, of its data base 
and of the variables it used for communication with other modules.
This description is intended to prepare the reader to look at the
source code, with the aid of a compiler and cross-reference listing.
Most important, from the point of view of the original
implementation, is a set of functional specifications of 
major program modules and information formats. These
specifications have been written in advance of module
design and modified as necessary if the detailed module design
process uncovers inconsistencies in the specification. It is 
through this specification process, and insistence on adherence to
the specification that technical management of the compiler
development has been carried out.<br><br>
We suspect that the most important form of documentation from
the point of view of continuing compiler maintenance will be the 
source code of the compiler itself. For this reason, we have
attempted to make the code readable (by a competent programmer, at
least) and are reluctant to rely on comments as secondary documentation.
Comments are used principally to describe the intended uses of 
global variables, and the function to be performed by major 
procedures. They also identify the numerous case instances that
occur in the compiler.<br><br>

<u>Special characters</u>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some ASCII characters used in the definition of PASCAL have no
exact counterparts in the EBCDIC character set. We have made the
following substitutions:
<pre style="margin:0;">
         ASCII          EBCDIC
 
         ^              @
         {   }          (* *)  or  /* */
         [   ]          (. .)
</pre>
<p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 40ch; padding:0;">in <u>array</u> references or declarations,
but not in <u>set</u> expressions.</p>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underscore symbol, _ is also allowed to be embedded
in an identifier, as it is in PL/1.<br><br><br>
<u>Compiler options</u>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you utilize the job control cards that we suggest, then
options giving maximum execution time, maximum lines to be printed,
and diagnostic level can be set on the EXEC card at the option of
the user. Options calling for supplementary listing output from
the compiler itself are set by toggles embedded within comments
in the source program to be compiled.<br><br>
<u>Compiler toggles</u>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain compiler options can be turned on or off by toggles
which take the form of $&lt;character&gt; embedded within a comment.
Thus the comment<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*)<br><br>
turns on (or turns off, if the options were previously on)
toggles that control printing of syntax trees and a symbol table
used in the internal representation of a program.
<br><br>
Toggles that may be useful to a Pascal programmer are:
<p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; padding:0;"><br><br>
</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 13ch; text-indent:-8ch; padding:0;">$L - list source program. This option is initially <u>on</u>.</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; padding:0;"><br>
</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 13ch; text-indent:-8ch; padding:0;">$M - list source program input lines without line members or
margin indicators, initially <u>off</u>.</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; padding:0;"><br>
</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 13ch; text-indent:-8ch; padding:0;">$Z - print symbol table contents after Pass 1. This option
also prints a &apos;block stack dump&apos; message in the listing
at various points. Initially <u>off</u>.</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; padding:0;"><br>
</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 13ch; text-indent:-8ch; padding:0;">$&boxv; - margin control. Sets a right margin cutoff on the 
input record. Initially 80 columns.</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; padding:0;">
</p>
<br>
These toggles useful primarily in debugging the compiler and
are initially <u>off</u>.
<p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; padding:0;"><br><br>
</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 13ch; text-indent:-8ch; padding:0;">$B - trace the syntax analysis. This diagnostic produces a
great many lines of output for each source language statement,
and should be used sparingly, over very local contexts.</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; padding:0;"><br>
</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 13ch; text-indent:-8ch; padding:0;">$P - dump the syntax trees used to represent the program,
at the beginning of Pass 2. An invalid tree may cause abnormal
termination in Pass 2 if this option is in use. This <u>should</u>
not happen, but might occur as a consequence of a syntax error in the
program.</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; padding:0;"><br>
</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 13ch; text-indent:-8ch; padding:0;">$E - print a listing of the emitted machine code. Output
comes from Pass 3.</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; padding:0;"><br>
</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 13ch; text-indent:-8ch; padding:0;">$D - print a summary of compilation statistics.</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; padding:0;"><br>
</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 13ch; text-indent:-8ch; padding:0;">$S - print the symbol table at the conclusion of Pass 2.
This listing gives all semantic information and storage allocations
to variables and constants.</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; padding:0;"><br>
</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 13ch; text-indent:-8ch; padding:0;">$T - print the symbolic triples that represent the program
at the beginning of Pass 2.</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; padding:0;"><br>
</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 13ch; text-indent:-8ch; padding:0;">$Z - print the symbol table at the conclusion of Pass 1.
Also, dump the block stack each time a new scope is opened by a 
procedure heading, <u>with</u> statement, or reference to a
<u>record</u> qualifier.</p><p style="margin: 0 0ch 0 5ch; padding:0;">
