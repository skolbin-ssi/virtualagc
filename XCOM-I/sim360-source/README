SUNY Stony Brook Pascal compiler written in XPL

The SUNY Stony Brook Pascal compiler was written in the mid 70's by the
Department of Computer Science at the State University of New York.  The
compiler was written in XPL and uses an LL(1) parser to generate code for
the IBM/360.  This is a three pass compiler that includes a Post Mortem Dump
program to help diagnose failing code.

The XPL compiler which came from SUNY closely resembles the XPL compiler
described in the book "A Compiler Generator" by McKeeman, Horning and Wortman.
Unlike the original XPL compiler this compiler does not use an MSP parser.  The
parser is probably SLR or LALR(1).  The Analyzer used to generate the tables was
not included in the release from SUNY.  This compiler generates code for the
IBM/360.

The code generated by both the Pascal and XPL compilers can be run on the
IBM/360 simulator.  The simulator, which was not part of the release from SUNY,
is written in C and can run on most machines that have a C compiler.  The
simulator has an EBCDIC translator that allows it to run executables from the
original release tape.
