FIREFLIES ON THE DARK MEADOW OF EARTH                                           
THE MEN AND WOMEN LOOKING UP THROUGH THE DOME IN THE CENTER OF THE              
CRATER OF ERATOSTHENES WERE TOO STUNNED TO CRY OUT AND SOME DID NOT             
UNDERSTAND ALL AT ONCE THE MEANING OF THOSE PIN POINTS ON THE SHADOWY           
FACE OF THE NEW EARTH THE LIGHTS BLOSSOMING OUTWARDS THEN DYING SO              
BRIGHT THEY COULD BE SEEN THROUGH THE CLOUDMASSES COVERING A LARGE PART         
OF EUROPE SO BRIGHT THEY COULD BE LOCATED AS LONDON PARIS BRUSSELS              
COPENHAGEN LENINGRAD ROME REYKJAVIK ATHENS CAIRO                                
THEN A FLARE NEAR MOSCOW THAT SPREAD OUT AND OUT AND OUT                        
SOME IN THE DOME RECOVERED MORE QUICKLY THAN OTHERS SCONE AND BROWARD           
TWO OF THE SOVIET NORTH AMERICAN OFFICERS PRESENT AT THE RECEPTION IN           
HONOR OF THE SOUTH ATLANTIC AXIS OFFICERS ACTED SWIFTLY ENOUGH TO               
DEFEND THEMSELVES                                                               
EVEN AS THE AXES TOOK OFF THEIR CAPS AND PULLED SMALL AUTOMATICS AND            
FLAT BOMBS FROM CLIPS WITHIN THE CAPS THE TWO AMERICANS REACHED FOR             
THE GUNS IN THEIR HOLSTERS                                                      
TOO LATE TO DO THEM MUCH GOOD IF THE ARGENTINEANS AND SOUTH AFRICANS            
NEAREST THEM HAD AIMED AT THEM THE AXES HAD NO SHOCK ON THEIR FACES             
THEY MUST HAVE KNOWN WHAT TO EXPECT AND THEIR WEAPONS WERE FIRING               
BEFORE THE FASTEST OF THE SOVIETS COULD REACH FOR THE BUTTS OF THEIR            
GUNS                                                                            
BUT THE AXES MUST HAVE HAD ORDERS TO KILL THE HIGHEST RANKING SOVIETS           
FIRST AT THESE THE FIRST FIRE WAS CONCENTRATED                                  
MARSHAL KOSSELEVSKY HAD HALF TURNED TO HIS GUEST MARSHAL                        
RAMIREZ ARMSTRONG HIS MOUTH WAS OPEN AND WORKING BUT NO WORDS CAME              
FROM IT THEN HIS EYES OPENED EVEN WIDER AS HE SAW THE STUBBY GUN                
IN THE ARGENTINEANS HAND HIS OWN HAND ROSE IN A DEFENSIVE WHOLLY                
FUTILE GESTURE                                                                  
RAMIREZ ARMSTRONGS GUN TWANGED THREE TIMES OTHER AXES BULLETS ALSO              
STRUCK THE RUSSIAN KOSSELEVSKY CLUTCHED AT HIS PAUNCH AND HE FELL               
FACE FORWARD THE   CALIBERS DID NOT HAVE MUCH ENERGY OR PENETRATE               
DEEPLY INTO THE FLESH BUT THEY EXPLODED ON IMPACT  THEY DID THEIR WORK          
WELL ENOUGH                                                                     
SCONE AND BROWARD TOOK ADVANTAGE OF NOT BEING IMMEDIATE TARGETS                 
GUNS IN HAND THEY DIVED FOR THE PROTECTION OF A MAN TALL BANK OF                
INSTRUMENTS BULLETS STRUCK THE METAL CASES AND EXPLODED FOR IN A FEW            
SECONDS THE AXES HAD ACCOMPLISHED THEIR PRIMARY MISSION AND WERE NOW            
OUT TO COMPLETE THEIR SECONDARY                                                 
BROWARD FELT A STING ON HIS CHEEK AS HE ROLLED BEHIND THE BANK HE               
PUT HIS HAND ON HIS CHEEK AND WHEN HE TOOK IT AWAY HE SAW HIS HAND              
COVERED WITH BLOOD BUT HIS PROBING FINGER FELT ONLY A SHALLOW OF                
FLESH HE FORGOT ABOUT THE WOUND EVEN IF IT HAD BEEN MORE SERIOUS HE             
WOULD HAVE HAD NO TIME TO TAKE CARE OF IT                                       
A SOUTH AFRICAN STEPPED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE BANK FIRING AS HE              
CAME                                                                            
BROWARD SHOT TWICE WITH HIS   THE DARK BROWN FACE SHOWERED INTO RED             
AND LOST ITS HUMAN SHAPE THE BODY TO WHICH IT WAS NOW LOOSELY ATTACHED          
CURVED BACKWARDS AND FELL ON THE FLOOR                                          
BROWARD CALLED SCONE ABOVE THE TWANG AND BOOM OF THE GUNS AND THE               
WHAROOP OF A BOMB CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING I CANT EVEN STICK MY HEAD                
AROUND THE CORNER WITHOUT BEING SHOT AT                                         
BROWARD LOOKED AT SCONE WHO WAS CROUCHED AT THE OTHER END OF THE BANK           
SCONES BACK WAS TO BROWARD BUT SCONES HEAD WAS TWISTED FAR ENOUGH               
FOR HIM TO SEE BROWARD OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE                             
EVEN AT THAT MOMENT WHEN BROWARDS THOUGHTS SHOULD HAVE EXCLUDED

EVERYTHING BUT THE FIGHT HE COULD NOT HELP COMPARING SCONES PROFILE             
TO A FACE CUT OUT OF ROCK THE HIGH BULBOUS FOREHEAD THICK BARS OF               
BONE OVER THE EYES DANTESQUE NOSE THIN LIPS AND CHIN JUTTING OUT                
LIKE A SHELF OF GRANITE MORE LIKE A NATURAL FORMATION WHICH HAPPENED            
TO RESEMBLE A CHIN THAN ANYTHING WHICH HAD TAKEN SHAPE IN A HUMAN WOMB          
UGLY MASSIVE BUT STRONG NOTHING OF PANIC OR FEAR IN THAT FACE  IT               
WAS AS STEADY AS HIS VOICE                                                      
OLD GIBRALTAR FACE THOUGHT BROWARD FOR PERHAPS THE HUNDREDTH TIME BUT           
THIS TIME HE DID NOT FEEL DISLIKE                                               
I CANT SEE ANY MORE THAN YOU  COLONEL HE SAID                                   
SCONE STILL SQUATTING SHIFTED AROUND UNTIL HE COULD BRING ONE EYE TO            
BEAR FULLY ON BROWARD IT WAS A PALE BLUE SO PALE IT LOOKED EMPTY                
UNHUMAN                                                                         
COLONEL                                                                         
NOW SAID BROWARD A BOMB GOT GENERAL MANSFIELD AND COLONELS OMATO                
AND INGRASS THAT GIVES YOU A FAST PROMOTION SIR                                 
WELL BOTH BE PROMOTED ABOVE THIS BANK IF AN AXE LOBS A BOMB OVER                
SAID SCONE WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE                                           
TO WHERE                                                                        
SCONE FROWNED  GRANITE WRINKLING  AND SAID ITS OBVIOUS THE AXES                 
WANT TO DO MORE THAN MURDER A FEW SOVIETS THEY MUST PLAN ON GETTING             
CONTROL OF THE BONEPHONES I KNOW I WOULD IF I WERE THEY IF THEY CAN             
CAPTURE THE CONTROL CENTER EVERY SOVIET ON THE MOON  EXCEPT FOR THE             
CHINESE  IS AT THEIR MERCY SO                                                   
WE MAKE A RUN FOR THE BR                                                        
IM NOT ORDERING YOU TO COME WITH ME SAID SCONE THATS ALMOST                     
SUICIDE BUT YOU WILL GIVE ME A COVERING FIRE                                    
ILL GO WITH YOU COLONEL                                                         
SCONE GLANCED AT THE CADUCEUSES ON BROWARDS LAPELS AND HE SAID                  
WELL NEED YOUR PROFESSIONAL HELP AFTER WE CLEAN OUT THE AXES NO                 
YOU NEED MY AMATEURISH HELP NOW SAID BROWARD AS YOU SEE  HE                     
JERKED HIS THUMB AT THE NEARLY HEADLESS ZULU  I CAN HANDLE A GUN AND            
IF WE DONT GET TO THE BONEPHONE CONTROLS FIRST LIFE WONT BE WORTH               
LIVING BESIDES I DONT THINK THE AXES INTEND TAKING ANY PRISONERS
