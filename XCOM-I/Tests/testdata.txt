FIREFLIES ON THE DARK MEADOW OF EARTH
THE MEN AND WOMEN LOOKING UP THROUGH THE DOME IN THE CENTER OF THE
CRATER OF ERATOSTHENES WERE TOO STUNNED TO CRY OUT AND SOME DID NOT
UNDERSTAND ALL AT ONCE THE MEANING OF THOSE PIN POINTS ON THE SHADOWY
FACE OF THE NEW EARTH THE LIGHTS BLOSSOMING OUTWARDS THEN DYING SO
BRIGHT THEY COULD BE SEEN THROUGH THE CLOUDMASSES COVERING A LARGE PART
OF EUROPE SO BRIGHT THEY COULD BE LOCATED AS LONDON PARIS BRUSSELS
COPENHAGEN LENINGRAD ROME REYKJAVIK ATHENS CAIRO
THEN A FLARE NEAR MOSCOW THAT SPREAD OUT AND OUT AND OUT
SOME IN THE DOME RECOVERED MORE QUICKLY THAN OTHERS SCONE AND BROWARD
TWO OF THE SOVIET NORTH AMERICAN OFFICERS PRESENT AT THE RECEPTION IN
HONOR OF THE SOUTH ATLANTIC AXIS OFFICERS ACTED SWIFTLY ENOUGH TO
DEFEND THEMSELVES
EVEN AS THE AXES TOOK OFF THEIR CAPS AND PULLED SMALL AUTOMATICS AND
FLAT BOMBS FROM CLIPS WITHIN THE CAPS THE TWO AMERICANS REACHED FOR
THE GUNS IN THEIR HOLSTERS
TOO LATE TO DO THEM MUCH GOOD IF THE ARGENTINEANS AND SOUTH AFRICANS
NEAREST THEM HAD AIMED AT THEM THE AXES HAD NO SHOCK ON THEIR FACES 
THEY MUST HAVE KNOWN WHAT TO EXPECT AND THEIR WEAPONS WERE FIRING
BEFORE THE FASTEST OF THE SOVIETS COULD REACH FOR THE BUTTS OF THEIR
GUNS
BUT THE AXES MUST HAVE HAD ORDERS TO KILL THE HIGHEST RANKING SOVIETS
FIRST AT THESE THE FIRST FIRE WAS CONCENTRATED
MARSHAL KOSSELEVSKY HAD HALF TURNED TO HIS GUEST MARSHAL
RAMIREZ ARMSTRONG HIS MOUTH WAS OPEN AND WORKING BUT NO WORDS CAME
FROM IT THEN HIS EYES OPENED EVEN WIDER AS HE SAW THE STUBBY GUN
IN THE ARGENTINEANS HAND HIS OWN HAND ROSE IN A DEFENSIVE WHOLLY
FUTILE GESTURE
RAMIREZ ARMSTRONGS GUN TWANGED THREE TIMES OTHER AXES BULLETS ALSO
STRUCK THE RUSSIAN KOSSELEVSKY CLUTCHED AT HIS PAUNCH AND HE FELL
FACE FORWARD THE   CALIBERS DID NOT HAVE MUCH ENERGY OR PENETRATE
DEEPLY INTO THE FLESH BUT THEY EXPLODED ON IMPACT  THEY DID THEIR WORK
WELL ENOUGH
SCONE AND BROWARD TOOK ADVANTAGE OF NOT BEING IMMEDIATE TARGETS
GUNS IN HAND THEY DIVED FOR THE PROTECTION OF A MAN TALL BANK OF
INSTRUMENTS BULLETS STRUCK THE METAL CASES AND EXPLODED FOR IN A FEW
SECONDS THE AXES HAD ACCOMPLISHED THEIR PRIMARY MISSION AND WERE NOW
OUT TO COMPLETE THEIR SECONDARY
BROWARD FELT A STING ON HIS CHEEK AS HE ROLLED BEHIND THE BANK HE
PUT HIS HAND ON HIS CHEEK AND WHEN HE TOOK IT AWAY HE SAW HIS HAND
COVERED WITH BLOOD BUT HIS PROBING FINGER FELT ONLY A SHALLOW OF
FLESH HE FORGOT ABOUT THE WOUND EVEN IF IT HAD BEEN MORE SERIOUS HE
WOULD HAVE HAD NO TIME TO TAKE CARE OF IT
A SOUTH AFRICAN STEPPED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE BANK FIRING AS HE
CAME
BROWARD SHOT TWICE WITH HIS   THE DARK BROWN FACE SHOWERED INTO RED
AND LOST ITS HUMAN SHAPE THE BODY TO WHICH IT WAS NOW LOOSELY ATTACHED
CURVED BACKWARDS AND FELL ON THE FLOOR
BROWARD CALLED SCONE ABOVE THE TWANG AND BOOM OF THE GUNS AND THE
WHAROOP OF A BOMB CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING I CANT EVEN STICK MY HEAD
AROUND THE CORNER WITHOUT BEING SHOT AT
BROWARD LOOKED AT SCONE WHO WAS CROUCHED AT THE OTHER END OF THE BANK
SCONES BACK WAS TO BROWARD BUT SCONES HEAD WAS TWISTED FAR ENOUGH
FOR HIM TO SEE BROWARD OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE
EVEN AT THAT MOMENT WHEN BROWARDS THOUGHTS SHOULD HAVE EXCLUDED
EVERYTHING BUT THE FIGHT HE COULD NOT HELP COMPARING SCONES PROFILE
TO A FACE CUT OUT OF ROCK THE HIGH BULBOUS FOREHEAD THICK BARS OF
BONE OVER THE EYES DANTESQUE NOSE THIN LIPS AND CHIN JUTTING OUT
LIKE A SHELF OF GRANITE MORE LIKE A NATURAL FORMATION WHICH HAPPENED
TO RESEMBLE A CHIN THAN ANYTHING WHICH HAD TAKEN SHAPE IN A HUMAN WOMB
UGLY MASSIVE BUT STRONG NOTHING OF PANIC OR FEAR IN THAT FACE  IT
WAS AS STEADY AS HIS VOICE
OLD GIBRALTAR FACE THOUGHT BROWARD FOR PERHAPS THE HUNDREDTH TIME BUT
THIS TIME HE DID NOT FEEL DISLIKE
I CANT SEE ANY MORE THAN YOU  COLONEL HE SAID
SCONE STILL SQUATTING SHIFTED AROUND UNTIL HE COULD BRING ONE EYE TO
BEAR FULLY ON BROWARD IT WAS A PALE BLUE SO PALE IT LOOKED EMPTY
UNHUMAN
COLONEL
NOW SAID BROWARD A BOMB GOT GENERAL MANSFIELD AND COLONELS OMATO
AND INGRASS THAT GIVES YOU A FAST PROMOTION SIR
WELL BOTH BE PROMOTED ABOVE THIS BANK IF AN AXE LOBS A BOMB OVER
SAID SCONE WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE
TO WHERE
SCONE FROWNED  GRANITE WRINKLING  AND SAID ITS OBVIOUS THE AXES
WANT TO DO MORE THAN MURDER A FEW SOVIETS THEY MUST PLAN ON GETTING
CONTROL OF THE BONEPHONES I KNOW I WOULD IF I WERE THEY IF THEY CAN
CAPTURE THE CONTROL CENTER EVERY SOVIET ON THE MOON  EXCEPT FOR THE
CHINESE  IS AT THEIR MERCY SO
WE MAKE A RUN FOR THE BR
IM NOT ORDERING YOU TO COME WITH ME SAID SCONE THATS ALMOST
SUICIDE BUT YOU WILL GIVE ME A COVERING FIRE
ILL GO WITH YOU COLONEL
SCONE GLANCED AT THE CADUCEUSES ON BROWARDS LAPELS AND HE SAID
WELL NEED YOUR PROFESSIONAL HELP AFTER WE CLEAN OUT THE AXES NO
YOU NEED MY AMATEURISH HELP NOW SAID BROWARD AS YOU SEE  HE
JERKED HIS THUMB AT THE NEARLY HEADLESS ZULU  I CAN HANDLE A GUN AND
IF WE DONT GET TO THE BONEPHONE CONTROLS FIRST LIFE WONT BE WORTH
LIVING BESIDES I DONT THINK THE AXES INTEND TAKING ANY PRISONERS
