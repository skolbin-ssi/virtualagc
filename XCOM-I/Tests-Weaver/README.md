This folder contains some XPL test programs sent to me by Dan Weaver and then, in Dan's words, "hacked up to my heart's delight".  :-)  (Actually not, but modified slightly to conform to what I think of as the constraints for XPL source code.)

Note that some of these programs use a few XPL/I constructs in addition to standard XPL, and therefore must be compiled as XPL/I rather than XPL.
