## Purpose:     A section of an attempt to reconstruct Sundance revision 306
##              as closely as possible with available information. Sundance
##              306 is the source code for the Lunar Module's (LM) Apollo
##              Guidance Computer (AGC) for Apollo 9. This program was created
##              using the mixed-revision SundanceXXX as a starting point, and
##              pulling back features from Luminary 69 believed to have been
##              added based on memos, checklists, observed address changes,
##              or the Sundance GSOPs.
