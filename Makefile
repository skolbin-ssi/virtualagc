# Filename:	Makefile
# Purpose:	This makefile is used (recursively) to build all
#		components of the Virtual AGC project, for Linux and
#		similar targets.
# Mods:		10/22/03 RSB	Wrote. 
#		11/02/03 RSB	Added Luminary131.
#		11/13/03 RSB	Added Colossus249.
#		05/01/04 RSB	Now provide yadsky also as yaDSKY, after install.
#		05/06/04 RSB	Now installs *.ini.
#		05/13/04 RSB	Now excludes *CVS* and *snprj* from the tarball.
#		05/14/04 RSB	Added PREFIX (for setting the installation
#				directory.
#		05/18/04 RSB	Added a datestamp to the dev. snapshot.
#		05/31/04 RSB	Move snapshot to ftp.
#		07/03/04 RSB	Added the Validation directory.
#		07/14/04 RSB	Added ControlPulseSim
#		08/09/04 RSB	Eliminate the contents of autom4te.cache/* when 
#				building a snapshot.  (These contents mess up
#				'configure' on some systems.)
#		08/10/04 RSB	Added the Sim* shell scripts to the installable
#				files.
#		08/12/04 RSB	Added NVER.  Went to v0.90.
#		08/13/04 RSB	Went to v20040813
#		08/24/04 RSB	Exclude ephemeris data from development snapshot,
#				but make a second file for it.
#		08/25/04 RSB	Added yaIMU.
# 		08/29/04 RSB	Made snapshot-ephemeris a separate target from
#				snapshot.
#		08/30/04 RSB	Moved the directory for snapshots from ftp space
#				into http space.
#		09/02/04 RSB	Changed yaIMU to yaUniverse.
#		01/10/05 RSB	Added binLEMAP.
#		04/30/05 RSB	Added CFLAGS
#		05/08/05 RSB	Added a 'snapshot' target.
#		05/14/05 RSB	Made some Mac OS X related changes for 'snapshot'.
#		05/28/05 RSB	Added yaDEDA.
#		06/02/05 RSB	Added yaAGS.
#		06/14/05 RSB	Updated the version code.
#		06/19/05 RSB	Added the NOGUI=yes command-line option.
#		07/06/05 RSB	Added Artemis072
#		07/28/05 RSB	Oops!  Had multiple "snapshot" targets.
#		08/04/05 RSB	Added the CURSES variable.
#		08/06/05 RSB	Now detect build-platform type using the
#				OSTYPE environment variable, which seems to
#				be reasonably consistent in distinguishing
#				at least the following cases:
#					OSTYPE=linux	
#					OSTYPE=darwin	(MacOS X)
#					OSTYPE=msys	(Msys on Win32)
#					OSTYPE=cygwin	(CygWin on Win32)
#				All of these cases use the "linux" Makefile,
#				but with very minor flourishes, except the
#				Msys case, which uses Makefile.Win32 instead.
#		01/09/06 RSB	Removed the prefix '-' from the lines that
#				build Artemis072.
#		02/26/06 RSB	Now creates a script called VirtualAgcUninstall
#				during installation.
#		03/05/07 RSB	Changed the default compiler flags to include
#				"-DALLOW_BSUB".  This allows yaAGC and friends
#				to pass instructions in the BSUB register upon
#				exiting from an interrupt-service routine.
#		03/01/09 RSB	Updated the version code.
#		03/05/09 RSB	Now builds VirtualAGC.
#		03/06/09 RSB	There are new targets: 'default' is the same 
#				as 'all'.  'all-archs' is like 'all', except 
# 				that 'all' builds only for the native platform
#				while 'all-archs' is used when running under
#				Linux to create the Linux, Win32, and Mac
#				stuff.
#		03/11/09 RSB	yaTelemetry added.
#		03/12/09 RSB	yaDSKY replaced by yaDSKY2, by default..
#		03/13/09 RSB	Added provisions for replacing yaDEDA by yaDEDA2.
#		03/16/09 RSB	"make clean" would fail if ./configure hadn't
#				been performed due to the fact that it isn't
#				needed when yaDSKY and yaDEDA aren't built.
#		03/19/09 RSB	Will now *try* to build yaDSKY/yaDEDA even if
#				yaDSKY2/yaDEDA2 are selected, and vice-versa.
#				However, failure won't a fatal error.  If find
#				it useful for both to be available for 
#				debugging.
#		03/28/09 RSB	Merged in yaACA3.
#		04/14/09 RSB	Made some mods to help this build in Solaris.
#		04/25/09 RSB	Fixed dev snapshots to exclude .svn directories.
#		04/26/09 RSB	Backed out all of the stuff that relies on
#				Makefile.Win32, and most stuff for OS 
#				auto-detection.  Removed the "os" target.
#				Removed the "install" target.
#		05/02/09 RSB	Added DEV_STATIC to change builds of binary
#				installers so that the wxWidgets-based programs
#				are dynamic-linked rather than static-linked.
#				However, it doesn't appear to me as though it
#				would change the size of the binary packages
#				in any significant way to use the dynamic
#				libraries, so I don't bother to do it.
#				Updated to make work with FreeBSD (PC-BSD 7.1).
#				Adjusted for SOLARIS.
#		05/23/09 RSB	Added Comanche055 to the normal build sequence.
#		06/07/09 RSB	Added Luminary099 to the normal build sequence.
#		06/29/09 RSB	Added the 'listings' target.
#		08/02/09 RSB	Now that I got rid of libreadline on the Win32
#				productin build (yesterday), I'm beginning to
#				experience readline-related problems (but 
#				different ones) on Linux.  I'm completely
#				disabling readline for all platforms for now,
#				until these problems can be fixed.
#		09/08/09 JL	Commented out Artemis072 from main build. 
#		01/30/10 RSB	Added yaASM.
#		02/16/10 RSB	Adjustments associated with getting
#				Artemis072 into the installers.
#		02/20/10 RSB	Updated version to 20100220 for release.
#		2011-04-27 JL	Added Colossus237.
#		2011-05-26 JL	Cleanup and rearrange. Add a 'missions' target to
#				build all mission versions. Make use of
#				parens/braces consistent. Add some shortcut 
#				variables for use in sub-make actions.
#		2016-08-07 RSB	Wasn't building the Validation "mission", needed
#				for the VirtualAGC installers.
#		2016-08-24 RSB	Solarium055 added to mission list.
#		2016-08-28 RSB	Somehow, the missions weren't being built before
#				the VirtualAGC installer, so neither the mission
#				binaries nor syntax-highlighted assembly listings
#				were included in the installer.
#		2016-08-29 RSB	Mods related to my personal-build situation, which
#				shouldn't affect anyone else.
#		2016-10-04 JL	Added 'format-missions' rukle to reformat all 
#				mission sources using yaYUL.
#		2016-10-21 RSB	Added AURORA12 to the missions.
#		2016-11-03 RSB	Added SUNBURST120 to the missions.
#		2016-11-08 RSB	Merged in block1 branch.
#		2016-11-16 RSB	Certain resources needed only by the "standard"
#				32-bit Linux VirtualAGC VM I'm now creating are
#				added to the installation bundle.  These are
#				related to debugging on Code::blocks. 
#		2016-11-17 RSB	Fixed a "sed --in-place ..." that doesn't work on
#				systems with non-GNU sed, such as FreeBSD or
#				Solaris.  Other fixes of a similar nature, for those
#				same operating systems.
#		2016-11-18 RSB	Removed yaACA2 from FreeBSD build.
#		2016-12-28 RSB	Added RETREAD44 to the mission list.
#		2017-02-04 RSB	Added SuperJob to the mission list.
#		2017-03-03 RSB	Added LUM99R2 to the list of missions.
#		2017-03-18 RSB	Added Luminary116 to mission list.
#		2017-03-27 RSB	Updated NVER for "releasing" a new installer and VM.
#		2017-04-17 RSB	Updated NVER.
#		2017-06-19 RSB	Updated NVER and added Sunburst37 to the mission list.
#		2017-08-01 MAS	Added LMY99R0 to the list of missions.
#		2017-08-23 RSB	Since Solarium doesn't presently assemble correctly in
#				Mac OS X, it is now only conditionally added to the 
#				mission list for non-Mac build systems.  Hopefully that's
#				temporary.
#		2017-08-24 RSB	Added FORCE_clang, FORCE_cc and FORCE_CC options.
#		2017-08-29 RSB	Added ZERLINA56 to mission list.
#		2017-08-31 RSB	Unconditionally returned Solarium to the mission list, since 
#				the yaYUL bug related to it that was expressing itself in 
#				Mac OS X has been fixed.
#		2018-09-04 MAS	Added LUMINARY130 to mission list.
#		2018-10-12 RSB	Added the Validation-hardware-simulation target.
#		2019-06-17 RSB	Added RETREAD50.
#		2019-07-23 RSB	Added SUNDIALE.
#		2019-07-27 MAS	Added LUM69R2.
#		2019-07-28 MAS	Added Luminary 97 and 98.
#		2019-07-31 RSB	Added COMANCHE051.
#		2019-08-16 RSB	Added Artemis071.
#		2019-09-17 MAS	Added Luminary 178.
#		2019-09-18 RSB	Added yaOBC and yaASM targets.
#		2019-09-22 RSB	Added Luminary163 and 173 missions.
#		2020-05-13 RSB	While I had added the yaOBC and yaASM (Gemini) targets a
#				couple of years ago, for some reason I didn't set them
#				to be built automatically.  Now they are.  Also, added
#				the yaLVDC (LVDC/PTC) target, and have it build automatically.
#
# The build box is always Linux for cross-compiles.  For native compiles:
#	Use "make MACOSX=yes" for Mac OS X.
#	Use "gmake SOLARIS=yes" for Solaris.
#	Use "make WIN32=yes" for Windows.
#	Use "gmake FREEBSD=yes" for FreeBSD.
#	Use "make" for Linux.
# On some platforms, we simply can't deduce what C or C++ compiler is being used
# from the settings indicated above.  An example is Mac OS X, in which older versions
# of Xcode used gcc, but newer ones use clang (which we don't support).  Or so I'm 
# told.  At any rate, you can force using specific C and C++ compilers by giving their
# full pathnames. For example:
#	make MACOSX=yes FORCE_cc=/path/to/gcc FORCE_CC=/path/to/g++
# I have no systems myself on which this is an issue, so that's a feature I've never
# tested in any meaningful way.  Another available switch is FORCE_clang=yes, which makes
# certain changes that *may* allow building with clang rather than gcc.

# NVER is the overall version code for the release.
NVER:=\\\"2019-09-22\\\"
DATE:=`date +%Y%m%d`

# DON'T CHANGE THE FOLLOWING SWITCH *********************************
# This switch determines whether or not wxWidgets programs are built
# statically linked or dynamically linked for the binary installers
# associated with the development snapshots.  It has nothing whatever
# to do with normal builds by normal users.  Uncommented, they're
# static.  Commented, they're dynamic.  And yes, DEV_STATIC *should*
# be repeated.  I haven't fully worked out yet how to get the dynamic
# libraries into the installers, however, so don't use them!
DEV_STATIC=DEV_STATIC=yes
# *******************************************************************

# Select compiler basenames.  We use
#	${cc}	C compiler
#	${CC}	C++ compiler
# These are almost always gcc and g++, respectively, but on some
# platforms it's necessary to use non-GNU compilers (even if the 
# GNU compilers are actually available and installed)  in order to 
# be able to access the native builds of wxWidgets for programs
# like yaDSKY2.

# The following target is used only on the build-system that creates the Linux
# (presently Xubuntu 14.04 32-bit) installation tarball.  Its purpose is to look
# into all of the executables being distributed, determine what system libraries
# they use, and to pack all of those into a separate directory that can be 
# included in the installation package.  The result, I hope, is to be able to 
# run the software on any Linux system, 32-bit or 64-bit, newer than 4/2014, and
# possibly on some older ones too.  To take advantage of these libraries
# (as opposed to just being limited to whatever libraries are already installed
# on the target Linux system), one needs to run VirtualAGC as
#	cd Resources
#	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib ../bin/VirtualAGC
# For 64-bit systems, it's additionally necessary to do
#	sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib
# on Debian or Ubuntu, and presumably the equivalent on Fedora, OpenSUSE, ....
#
# Although the libraries are put into a folder called lib/, I wouldn't recommend
# copying them into system directories like /lib, /usr/lib, or /usr/local/lib.
