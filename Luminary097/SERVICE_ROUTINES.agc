## Copyright:   Public domain.
## Filename:    SERVICE_ROUTINES.agc
## Purpose:     A section of Luminary revision 97.
##              It is part of the reconstructed source code for the
##              second release of the flight software for the Lunar 
##              Module's (LM) Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) for Apollo 11.
##              It was created to fix two incorrect ephemeris constants in
##              Luminary 96, as described by anomaly report LNY-59.
##              The code has been recreated from a copy of Luminary 99
##              revision 001, using asterisks indicating changed lines in
##              the listing and Luminary Memos #83 and #85, which list 
##              changes between Luminary 97 and 98, and 98 and 99. The
##              code has been adapted such that the resulting bugger words
##              exactly match those specified for Luminary 97 in NASA drawing
##              2021152D, which gives relatively high confidence that the
##              reconstruction is correct.
