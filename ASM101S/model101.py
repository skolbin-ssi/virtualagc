******************************************************************************
                               *** Warning ***
                               
    There are several issues with the design of the assembly-language
    itself, or at least with my understanding of how to deal with its issues,
    that turn some aspects of the code-generator's algorithm in an ad hoc
    mess of special cases, with no guarantee that the algorithm is generally
    correct.
    
    A big culprit is the use of the same mnemonic in many cases for:
    
            SRS-type instruction (which assemble to halfwords)
                                    vs
            RS-type instructions of subtype AM=1 (assembling to fullwords)
                                    vs
            RS-type instructions of subtype AM=0 (assembling to fullwords)
    
    Another big culprit is the fact that *some* SRS-type instructions and 
    RS-type subtype AM=0 instructions (but no AM=1 instructions) differ in 
    their addressing of halfword operands vs fullword operands ... with 
    *no* documented way to determine which instructions do and which do not.
    
    As I say, this makes the code that computes these distinctions a real,
    huge mess.  It needs to be redesigned, but at present I see no obvious
    way to do so.
******************************************************************************

Structure of the Code Generator
-------------------------------

The Assembler as a whole proceeds in a sequence of 5 passes, more or less, 
of which the first one has already occurred befor the code generator 
(`generateObjectCode`) has been called.  That initial pass resolves all of the 
macro language (variables of the form &VAR, sequence symbols of the 
form .SYMBOL, macro expansion, and inclusion of code via the `COPY` pseudo-op, 
continuation lines), leaving only lines of "pure" AP-101 assembly-language 
code for processing.  Besides this, it has also divided the lines in to fields 
`name`, `operation`, and `operand`, the latter of which may include the 
end-of-line comment, if any.

Thus `generateObjectCode` itself has 4 passes:

    Pass 0: Uses the operand parser (`parserASM`) to parse each operand and 
            provide the parsed form as an AST (`ast`) appropriate to the 
            particular `operation`.  (This is provided as a separate pass, so
            that the "lookahead" in pass 1, see below, does not have reparse
            any lines.)
    Pass 1: Processes `CSECT` pseudo-ops and any other pseudo-ops affecting
            the control sections and the position pointers within the control
            sections.  It's purpose is to resolve all symbols, and in particular
            to determine the addresses of all symbols.  To do so, it must
            determine the alignments and amount of memory occupied by all
            CPU/MSC/DCE instructions and DC/DS pseudo-ops.  However, there
            is ambiguity for some mnemonics as to whether they are RS-type
            instructions or SRS-type instructions, the two of which occupy
            different amounts of memory, and this ambiguity cannot be resolved
            syntactically in most cases.  Therefore, where there is ambiguity,
            pass 2 must sometimes perform a certain amount of lookahead, 
            involving the `ast` and other intermediate data created in pass 1, 
            to determine the sizes of memory displacements that can resolve the 
            ambiguity.
    Pass 2: Pass 1 has done a good job (or at least *the* job) of correctly
            determining the size of SRS vs RS instructions, but a poor job
            determining the locations of symbols for the symbol table.  Pass 2
            is essentially a repeat of Pass 1, except that it just directly
            uses the instruction sizes determined by Pass 1, rather than 
            attempting to determine them itself.
    Pass 3: Uses the results of passes 0 and 2 to actually generate the 
            object code and constant data stored in memory.

Some of these passes have what might be thought of as "mini-passes" between
them and the next pass, in order to resolve minor issues.  

Pseudo-Addresses
----------------

A unique but "random" 28-bit "random", excluding all 0's and all 1's, 
left-shifted by 36 bits, is assigned as a hashcode to each CSECT (or DSECT) and 
each EXTRN symbol. These are explicitly seeded, so as to make the sequence 
repeatable, but the exact seed isn't significant.

The purpose of this sequence of random numbers is to provide a workable (if 
unfortunately not theoretically perfect) means of computing arithmetical 
expressions optionally involving addresses of symbols.  Addresses are limited
to 24 bits in AP-101S, but prior to linking we don't know the actual addresses
but only the offsets within control sections.  And for EXTRN symbols, we don't
even know that much.  The values we use in computing arithmetical expressions
are 64-bit signed integers like so:
    hashcode + 32-bit offset For local symbols (offset is in halfwords)
    hashcode                 For EXTRN symbols
    32-bit number            For plain number
For correctly-formed expressions (i.e., those not involving illegal combinations
of address symbols), this always produces the correct results.  (Note that 
"pairing" of EXTRN symbols in expressions is not allowed.)  In particular, we're
concerned about producing the correct results for expressions like:
    symbol + number
    symbol1 - symbol2        where both symbols are in the same control section.

The hashed addresses are stored directly in the `symtab` dictionary,
so that they're easily accessed by the expression evaluator when presented with
a symbol.  At the end of the recursive evaluation of such an expression, the 
final hashcode can be extracted from the result and looked up in the
`hashcodeLookup` dictionary to determine what CSECT or EXTRN symbol it relates
to, if any.  Here's an example, involving an EXTRN symbol, two local symbols in
the same control section (thus having the same hashcode in their hashed 
addresses) and a few literal numbers:
    LOCAL1 + NUMBER1 + EXTERN - LOCAL2 + NUMBER2 * NUMBER3 
In the computation, the symbols are represented by the numerical values
    EXTERN = hashcode1
    LOCAL1 = hashcode2 + offset1
    LOCAL2 = hashcode2 + offset2
Since hashcode2-hashcode2 cancels out, the result of the calculation is
    result = hashcode1 + (offset1 + NUMBER1 - offset2 + NUMBER2 * NUMBER3)
or just
    result = hashcode1 + NUMBER4
which can be separated by the operations:
    NUMBER4  = result & 0x00000000FFFFFFFF
    buffer   = result & 0x0000000F00000000
    hashcode = result & 0xFFFFFFF000000000
`buffer` is an unused area between the 32-bit numerical value and the 28-bit
`hashcode`.

But (you ask), what if the NUMBER4 part of the calculation overflows?  If there
is positive overflow, it can almost always be detected by the value of the 
`buffer`, but in extreme cases it results in a `hashcode` which is illegal
and fails lookup.  If there's negative overflow, then in almost all cases
`hashcode` will be all 1's, but since all 1's is not a legal hashcode, we can
use it as an indication that the result is purely numerical, without a 
hashcode.

"Second Operands" of SRS and RS Instructions
--------------------------------------------

For some instructions, the "second operand" (or more-specifically, D2) is in
units of halfwords, while in others it is in units of fullwords.  For example,
if the address of a byte is 40 (decimal), then its halfword address is 20 and
its fullword address is 10.  I.e., D2 might be 20 or 10 respectively.

So far, my reading of the AP-101S Principles of Operation has not elicited any 
complete, unambiguous explanation of which instructions or which.  My 
probably-imperfect inferences are these:

  1.  As a rule of thumb, if the most-significant bit of the opcode is 0, then
      the instruction uses fullword addresses, while if it is 1, then the
      instruction uses halfword addresses.
  2.  However, floating-point instructions are exceptions, and always use 
      halfword addresses.  (There's some support for that as well, maybe, in that
      on p. 8-3 the POO says "Second operands for the floating point set are
      no longer restricted by hardware to even halfword boundary address 
      locations.")
  3.  These rules apply only to SRS and RS AM=0 instructions, whereas halfword
      addressing is always used for RS AM=1 instructions.

One implication of these rules is that in cases an SRS or RS AM=0 instruction
might require a fullword D2 where the displacement is actually odd number of
halfwords, then an RS AM=1 instruction would have to be used instead.

Determining Types of SRS/RS Instructions
----------------------------------------

(in progress)

Regarding those mnemonics which may be SRS or RS type instructions, depending
on the particular mnemonic there are up to 4 cases to distinguish between:

  1.  Instructions which *must* be type SRS.
  2.  Instructions which *must* be type RS AM=0.
  3.  Instructions which *must* be type RS AM=1.
  4.  Instructions which might be some one of several of the above.

Here are the rules to classify an instruction in this group.

  A.  If the mnemonic is in the SRS-only set, then it is SRS.  (Obviously!)
  B.  If there is an explicit X2, then the instruction is RS AM=1.
  C.  If there's no explicit B2 and D2 is a constant (i.e., without an 
      upper-word hash) then code as RS AM=0 with B2=3.  (Recall:  For AM=0 B2=3, 
      base register is discarded.)
  D.  If no explicit B2 but D2's hash matches current control section:
      1)  Special case of mnemonic BC (possibly aliased from B, BZ, etc.) and
          displacement from updated IC is >-56 and <0, code as BCB.
      2)  Special case of mnemonic BC (possibly aliased) and displacement from
          updated IC is >=0  and <56, code as BCF.
      3)  If displacement from updated IC is >=0 and <2048, then code as 
          RS AM=1 (with B2=3, X2=0, IA=0, I=0).
      4)  If the current control section is in USING, then code as
          RS AM=0 (with B2=USING reg for current section).
      5)  Otherwise, fail.
  E.  If no explicit B2 but D2's hash match one in USING:
  `   1)  If the unhashed D2 is >=0 and <56, code as SRS
          (with B2=register from USING).
      2)  If the unhashed D2 is >=0 and <2048, code as RS AM=1 (with B2 from
          USING).
      3)  Code as RS AM=0 (with B2 from USING).
  F.  If explicit B2 and ...

`literalPools` is intended to keep track of what the System/360 assembler 
manual refers to as "literals" (vs what *I* refer to as literals), namely
strings like "=1234", "=X'ABCD'", and so on.  In IBM World(TM), these appear
within operands of instructions, but instead of treating them as immediate data,
perhaps because the instruction doesn't accept immediate data, the assembler
stores their values in a "literal pool" and uses their addresses in the code it
generates for the instructions using them.  The probem with them from my 
perspective is that the literal pools *always* follow (eventually!) the 
instructions using the literals, so literals are always end up being forward 
references.  Thus we need some way to track them until the literal pool is
eventually formed.  There can be multiple literal pools, each defined by the
appearance of a `LTORG` pseudo-op (marking the beginning of the pool), as well
as the default literal pool at the end of the first CSECT.  All literals
are stored in the literal pool defined by the *following* `LTORG`, or else in
the default pool if there are any literals after the final `LTORG`.  Duplicate
literals within any of these LTORG-to-LTORG intervals are stored only once in
that literal pool.  However, duplicates across literal pools are stored in each
of the corresponding literal pools.  Literals of the form "=A(...)", such as
"=A(*+5)" are not present in Shuttle flight software and are not supported.
If two literals have the same value but different attributes, then they are not
considered duplicates.  For example, =X'0000001234' and =X'1234' have the same
numerical values when considered as constants, but have different lenth 
attributes, because they occupy different amounts of memory.

There is one entry in `literalPools` for each literal pool, with the last one
being the default pool.  Thus if there are N `LTORG` pseudo-ops, then there are
N+1 entries.  Each entry is also a list.  The entries of those lists are:
    0. The name of the CSECT containing the literal pool.
    1. The byte offset within the CSECT at which the pool starts.
    2. The alignment (8, 4, 2) of the literal pool itself
    3. A list of the same length as `literalPools` itself, but only the entries
       corresponding to the ones below are used, and are the address offsets 
       into the literal pool of those entries.
    4. The total size (in bytes) of the pool.
    5+. Dictionaries, one for each unique literal in the section.
The dictionaries just mentioned have the keys:
    "value"        The integer, boolean, or string value of the literal.
    "L"            The length attribute.
    "T"            The type attribute.
    etc.           (Any other attributes it eventually occurs to me are needed.)
Note that when a new literal pool is started, it's always assigned to 
CSECT "" (even if there isn't one) and an address within the CSECT of 0.
These things are adjusted later when an `LTORG` or end of source is encountered
to close out the literal pool.  The literals do not necessary appear in the
pool in the same order as encounted in the source code.  Rather, the are sorted
primarily in reverse order of alignment boundaries (8, 4, 2), and only 
secondarily on the order encountered.  The offset list (item #3 above)
is filled in after completion of the pass which discovers all of the literals and 
assigns them to pools.  Naively, it may appear that it would make more sense 
to add the address offsets as new key/value pairs in items 4+ themselves, but 
that would render lookup impossible since you'd have to know the offset before
performing the lookup.

# Generate object code for AP-101S.

'''
Work is done in place on the `source` array, which is a list of "property"
structures, one for each line if source code, including all of the macro
definitions from the macro library.  However, all manipulations of symbolic
variables and expansion of macros has been performed, so only the lines of
pure assembly-language code (i.e., CPU instructions and related pseudo-ops)
are processed.  Moreover, while continuation lines are present, all after the
first in any sequence have been merged into the first line of the sequence.
The `macros` argument is provided merely to have a list of operations which
can be ignored.

The only manipulations done to any particular entry of `source` are:
    1. The `errors` field may be augmented via the `error` function.
    2. Non-previously-existing fields may be added to hold object-code data.
I.e., no existing fields other than `errors` are affected.

Additionally, the function returns a dictionary of non-line-by-line info about
the assembly.

Note that addresses are in units of bytes.

Data for the compilation that isn't on a line-by-line basis.  Regarding the
`symtab` dictionary, there's an entry for each symbol, and each entry is 
itself a dictionary.  Each of those dictionaries has a "type" key to indicate 
the general category it falls into, chosen from among the following:

   "EXTERNAL"    Indicates an `EXTRN` symbol.
   "DATA"        Indicates `DS` or `DC`.
   "INSTRUCTION" Indicates a program label.
   "ENTRY"       Indicates an `ENTRY` point, but otherwise identical to an
                 "INSTRUCTION".
   "CSECT"       Indicates `CSECT`, `DSECT`, or `START`.
   "EQU"         Indicates `EQU`.
   "LITERAL"     Indicates an integer, boolean, or string constant value.
   ... presumably, more later ...
   
Besides the "type" key, there could be one or more of following keys:
   "section"     (string) Name of the control section containg the symbol.
   "address"     (integer) Halfword ddress of the symbol within the control section.
   "value"       Tricky, so see explanatin that follows.

Regarding "value", this is what's used in computing the value of arithmetic 
expressions involving the symbol.  There are four cases:

1. For symbols which cannot be used in arithmetic expressions, there is no 
   "value" field.
2. For symbols representing addresses ("EXTERNAL", "DATA", "INSTRUCTION", 
   "ENTRY", "CSECT"), this is a 64-bit integer pseudo-address that combines the
   "section" and "address" fields into a single number.
3. For symbols representing constant values rather than addresses ("LITERAL"),
   is the actual integer, boolean, or string value of the constant.
4. "EQU" symbols may represent any of the cases mentioned above, and the "value"
   field will also match those cases accordingly.

The `unhash` function can be used to return any "value"-type integer into 
its constituent "section"/"address", or to determine that it's just an integer
value rather than an address at all.

                We have a conundrum here.  For the mnemonics in argsSRSandRS
                there is both an RS version of the instruction
                (2 halfwords) and an SRS version of the instruction (1 halfword).
                All of the SRS versions could be encoded as the RS version 
                without functional difficulty, I think, but aren't (presumably
                to save a little memory).  There's no syntactic difference.
                The old assembler decided, I guess, based on the size of D2:
                    0 <= DS < 56         -> SRS
                    56 <= DS             -> RS
                But we can't always determine the size of DS in earlier passes, 
                because it may involve unresolved forward references.
                Or in other words, we often cannot determine the size of the
                instruction without already knowing the size of the instruction.
