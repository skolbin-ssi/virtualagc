## Filename:    INTERRUPT_LEAD_INS.agc
## Purpose:     A section of Comanche revision 044.
##              It is part of the reconstructed source code for the
##              original release of the flight software for the Command
##              Module's (CM) Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) for Apollo 10.
##              The code has been recreated from a copy of Comanche 055. It
##              has been adapted such that the resulting bugger words
##              exactly match those specified for Comanche 44 in NASA drawing
##              2021153D, which gives relatively high confidence that the
##              reconstruction is correct.
## Assembler:   yaYUL
