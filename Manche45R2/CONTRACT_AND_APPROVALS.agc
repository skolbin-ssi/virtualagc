## Purpose:     A section of Manche45 revision 2.
##              It is part of the reconstructed source code for the
##              final, flown release of the flight software for the Command
##              Module's (CM) Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) for Apollo 10.
##              The code has been recreated from a copy of Comanche 055. It
##              has been adapted such that the resulting bugger words
##              exactly match those specified for Manche 45/2 in NASA drawing
##              2021153D, which gives relatively high confidence that the
##              reconstruction is correct.

## <b>Reconstruction:</b> We don't know of any surviving specific contemporary
## documentation supporting the material in this log section, absent an
## Apollo-era assembly listing of it.  The section contains
## only comments and no executable code.  We have simply modeled the Comanche 45/2 version of it on the 
## corresponding log section of Comanche 45, but have changed a handful of
## items in ways that seem sensible to us.  The annotations below thus 
## provide our common-sense reasoning on the matter, rather than justification from 
## contemporary documentation.

## <b>Reconstruction:</b> The signature names and titles below are not
## actually known for certain.  Because Comanche 45 through 45/2 were separated by
## less than 2 months in time (see below), we assume that personnel turnover 
## in that limited period of time would be unlikely. Hence we have retained the 
## same names and titles for Comanche 45/2 as for Comanche 45. Also, these are
## the same names and titles as appear in Comanche 55.
## <br><br>
## On the other hand, the DATE fields below are more speculative, 
## and are very likely to be wrong but unlikely to be <i>too</i> wrong. In 
## <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/listings/Comanche044/CONTRACT_AND_APPROVALS.agc.html">
## an earlier reconstruction, Comanche 44</a>, it was concluded as a 
## rule of thumb that the signoff dates listed in the CONTRACT AND APPROVALS
## section should precede the date of release of the software to manufacturing
## by about 3 weeks.  To determine the date of release to manufacturing,
## the best information we're aware of comes from
## <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/R-700.pdf#page=170">
## <i>MIT's Role in Project Apollo, Final Report</i>, Table 4-II</a>, where
## we find the Comanche 45 was released in March 1969, and that Comanche 45/2 was
## released in April 1969.  This is a bit non-specific, but if we interpret
## Comanche 45/2's release date as April 15 and subtract 3 weeks,
## we tentatively arrive at a signoff date of March 25.  That happened to
## be a Tuesday in 1969.
