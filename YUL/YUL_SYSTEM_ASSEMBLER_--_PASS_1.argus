R0005              YUL SYSTEM PASS 1 READS CARDS ONLY (NEW ASSEMBLY), OR MERGES CARDS WITH SYPT OR SYLT RECORDS (REVI-
R0007   SION OR VERSION ASSEMBLY).  ONE-SHOT MODIFICATION OF SUBPROGRAMS WILL BE ALLOWED SOME DAY, CARDS BEING MERGED
R0009   WITH SYLT RECORDS BUT NO PERMANENT CHANGES BEING MADE IN THE SYLT.  CORRECT ORDERING OF CARD NUMBERS IS REQUIRED
R0011   (ON PAIN OF CUSSING IN NEW ASSEMBLY, OR REJECTION OF ALL INPUT IN REVISION OR VERSION ASSEMBLY).

R0015              PASS 1 COPIES SYPTSAVES AND SYLTSAVES FROM TAPE 1 TO TAPE 3, AND BYPTSAVES FROM TAPE 1 TO TAPE 4.
R0017   IT ALSO WRITES POPO (PASS ONE PROGRAM OUTPUT) RECORDS ON TAPE 2.  ITS CHIEF OPERATIONS ON SOME IMPORTANT TYPES
R0019   OF CARDS ARE LISTED BELOW:

R0020           1) INSTRUCTIONS AND CONSTANTS.   PROCESSING OF LOCATION FIELD (GENERALLY AFFECTING THE LOCATION COUNTER)
R0022              AND DEFINITION OF LOCATION SYMBOL ARE DONE.  FIXED MEMORY IS RESERVED AS NEEDED.  LEFTOVERS ARE
R0024              MARKED AS SUCH.  15 BITS OF CODED INFORMATION (MOSTLY OP CODE) ARE ATTACHED TO INSTRUCTION CARDS.

R0026           2) IS,=,EQUALS.   AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO DEFINE THE LOCATION SYMBOL BY EVALUATING THE ADDRESS FIELD.
R0028              FAILURE OF THIS OPERATION BY REASON OF AN UNDEFINED ADDRESS SYMBOL "NEARLY DEFINES" THE SYMBOL.

R0030           3) ERASE.   ERASABLE MEMORY IS RESERVED AS REQUESTED. EXCEPT FOR LEFTOVER ERASE CARDS.

R0032           4) OTHER CLERICAL CODES.   THESE GENERALLY HAVE THEIR EFFECT IN PASS 1 (E.G. MANIPULATING THE LOCATION
R0034              COUNTER).
