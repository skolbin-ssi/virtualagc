## Copyright:   Public domain.
## Filename:    INTERRUPT_LEAD_INS.agc
## Purpose:     A section of Luminary revision 96.
##              It is part of the reconstructed source code for the
##              original release of the flight software for the Lunar 
##              Module's (LM) Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) for Apollo 11.
##              The code has been recreated from a previously reconstructed
##              copy of Luminary 97 by undoing changes described in anomaly
##              report LNY-59. The code has been adapted such that the
##              resulting bugger words exactly match those specified for
##              Luminary 96 in NASA drawing 2021152D, which gives relatively
##              high confidence that the reconstruction is correct.
